## Installation

1. Install [Python 3.11] and [Poetry]. I recommend using [pyenv] to manage your Python
   versions.

3. Clone this repository and `cd` into it.

4. Run `poetry install` to install dependencies.

5. Create a `.env` file in the root directory of the project. Set the `DISCORD_TOKEN`
   environment variable to your Discord bot token. You can generate a new token in the
   [Discord Developer Portal].

7. Run `poetry run python bot.py` to start the bot.
